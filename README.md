# Marvel Legendary - Solo Gameplay

This project aims to make solo-gameplay less tedious by providing a web-based client to play in.
The current scope of the project is to provide a single-player mode using the Advanced Solo Rules in the Dark City expansion.
It would also be an ideal client to test homebrew cards in quickly.
